#Technical Review Questions

The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) would like to further understand how your project fits into the cloud native ecosystem. 

During a technical review, the intent is to understand and validate the cloud native software lifecycle of the project and whether it isnâ€™t in line with the CNCF maturation process and levels. For the purposes of the general technical review and further domain reviews, the questions follow the cloud native software lifecycle day schemas:

**Day 0 - Planning Phase.** This phase covers design and architecture of the cloud native project.

**Day 1 - Installation and Deployment Phase.** This phase covers initial installation and deployment of the design developed during Day 0 - Planning Phase.

**Day 2 - Day-to-Day Operations Phase** This phase covers post-deployment operations including monitoring, maintenance, auditing and troubleshooting.

##How to complete the Technical Review

You will see three more comments after this one covering Day 0, Day 1 and Day 2. Please `reply` to each comment with your answers. The issue author can then indicate readiness for a Domain Specific Review, or further review by an associated Technical Advisory Group (TAG), by marking the reviews complete in the task list below.

As a project applying to CNCF Sandbox, you are required to complete the questions for **Day 0 - Planning Phase**. Please also review and respond to **Day 1** and **Day 2** questions as applicable. Though not required for your Sandbox application, they will be required for Incubation and Graduation.
